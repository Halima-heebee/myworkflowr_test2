## This is to test a package that I am writing for you.


You know I am not much of a great writer but my **LOVE** for you always brings out that faboulous writing skills that I am too lazy to explore. See below my reasons for loving you unconditionally:

```{r one, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
Obviously I have no particular reason, its natural babe. I just want to grow old with you with all the good things in life
```

# Love Range plot

Here is a graph to show my change in rate of love with age:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
RANGE <- read.csv("C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/RANGE.csv")
ggplot(RANGE, aes(LOVE, AGE)) + geom_point(col="tomato2", size=3)
```

You can see that it will continue to grow at an exponential rate.
